Basic Honeypot plugin for Contact Form 7 to drastically reduce spam on form submissions without user interaction.

== Description ==

I like to use Contact Form 7 on most of my WordPress sites. It's a powerful form manager that suits all my needs. I don't like to use external calls to protect the forms from spam submissions though (like reCaptcha or hCaptcha) and don't want to present a manual captcha to a user (math or other puzzle). Since I couldn't find a really basic honeypot script that works on most entries, I created one here. Hopefully it's useful to someone else also.

== Setup ==

- Install the plugin using the regular plugin setup routine or upload the entire apiosys-honeypot-cf7 folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
- Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress, you MUST have Contact Form 7 AND Flamingo installed and enabled.
- Add the following shortcodes to your Contact Form 7 forms:

[honeypot] - Adds the hidden honeypot field\
[timestamp] - Adds time-based validation

- Complete the rest of the options (a generally good working set of values is enabled by default).

== What tests are used? ==

- A Honeypot Field
- Time-Based Validation
- Basic Content Analysis

== Does it really work? ==

It has been tested on several high-traffic WP sites. I see a return of ~ 1 ‰ (i.e. 1 in a thousand) of spam going through. That usually corresponds to humans paid to fill forms or sophisticated bots. Please feel free to contribute to make it even better.

== Screenshots ==

1. Spam caught when Honeypot field was filled.
2. Spam caught when the form was submitted too quickly.
3. Spam caught when too many URLs are present in the message fields.
4. Spam caught when certain keywords are detected.
