# Why this plugin?

I like to use Contact Form 7 on most of my WordPress sites. It's a powerful form manager that suits all my needs. I don't like to use external calls to protect the forms from spam submissions though (like reCaptcha or hCaptcha) and don't want to present a manual captcha to a user (math or other puzzle). Since I couldn't find a really simple honeypot script that works on most entries, I created one here. Hopefully it's useful to someone else also.

## Setup

- Install the plugin using the regular plugin setup routine or upload the entire contact-form-7-simple-honeypot folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
- Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress, you MUST have Contact Form 7 AND Flamingo installed and enabled.
- Add the following shortcodes to your Contact Form 7 forms:

`[honeypot]` - Adds the hidden honeypot field
`[timestamp]` - Adds time-based validation

Example form:

```
<label> Your Name
    [text* your-name] </label>

<label> Your Email
    [email* your-email] </label>

<label> Your Message
    [textarea your-message] </label>

__[honeypot]__
__[timestamp]__

[submit "Send"]
```

- Complete the rest of the options (a default generally good working set of values is enabled by default).

## What tests are used?

- A Honeypot Field
- Time-Based Validation
- Basic Content Analysis
